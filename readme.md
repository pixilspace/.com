# Pixilspace
I'm building Pixilspace as a tool to help me express myself and connect with others like me. And whether you'd like to contribute to the project or use Pixilspace as the basis for your own artistic playground, the following is how you would set up the Pixilspace Local Environment.

## Prereqs
I had the following on my system when I got this to build:
- OS: Linux Mint
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- Gulp: `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- Firebase: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- [A Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com)

## Install
